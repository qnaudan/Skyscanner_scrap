# Web Scraping personal project

Gathering airflight fares on Skyscanner website.

Back in 2018, I needed to monitor airflight fares during a stay abroad. I spent a few afternoons in a Starbucks coffee to learn what was required.

This project involves browser automation with [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) and [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing) to deal with several browsers.

Here's a user-friendly app.

## Installation

Create the directory below to store files of saved data

```bash
mkdir Workbooks
```

Install or update required libraries

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Launch the app

```bash
python3 skyscanner_scrap.py
```

## Usage

They are 5 keys parameters the user can modify :

- Departure and Destination cities are inputs

- A expected number of days of stay in the destination is key in, the app will also look shorter and longer stay opportunities up to 50% of this number (key in 0 day for One Way flights)

- The starting day to look up the first flight (like 30 days from now) and the span of search in days (the 60 nest days for instance)
